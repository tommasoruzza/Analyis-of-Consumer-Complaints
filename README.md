# Analyis-of-Consumer-Complaints

The project was commissioned by FinServ Solutions, a company specialised in software solutions for complaint management in the financial sector. The goal was to redesign and restructure the spreadsheet used to analyse consumer complaints, in order to improve readability, visibility of critical information and the speed of insights extraction. The new structure had to enable better monitoring of customer issues, geographical distribution, response times and recurring topics.
